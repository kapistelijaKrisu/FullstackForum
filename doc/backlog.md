## priority before submit

- cleared

## after summer

### priority
- button for mod to disable post
- proper error message for incorrect login
- delete comments and name variables of cat/post/com
- edit category/forumposts/comments
- redirect from not existing post leads to undefined category, redirect to error page so bug is never encountered
- likes, view count
- backend validator for number type params (getters mostly)
### optional
- deal with desync coming from changing category
- update node (requires updating bcrypt)
- save settings for user in db to carry settings, custom paging, theme, profile
- make logo in forumpost listing an image link
- change color when mouse hovering over linkable shit
- follow own posts
- follow other's posts
- mobile view
- deploy via docker
- insert pictures, gifs to comments
- db init into script
- lint
- convert viewed posttime to local time
- have categories visible/writable only for mods
- find nicer form components to make validation more clear and simpler
- sort by views/popularity
- improve personal page (exact way to be defined, partially done with other tasks)
- make background fancier
- tests, proptypes
